    "1.Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning that combines multiple weak learners (typically simple models that perform slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong learner. It does this by training the weak learners sequentially, with each new learner focusing on the mistakes of its predecessors."

    "2.Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Accuracy: Boosting often leads to models with higher accuracy compared to individual models.\n",
    "Robustness to Overfitting: Boosting techniques like AdaBoost tend to be less prone to overfitting, especially when regularization techniques are used.\n",
    "Versatility: Boosting can be applied to various types of models and loss functions.\n",
    "Handling Bias: By focusing on misclassified instances, boosting effectively reduces bias in the model.\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally Intensive: Boosting can be more computationally expensive and time-consuming than other methods.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Noisy Data: Boosting can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers since it tries to correct every mistake, which might amplify the noise.\n",
    "Complexity: Models generated by boosting can be complex and less interpretable than single models."

    "\n",
    "Initialization: Start with a base model (weak learner) that makes predictions.\n",
    "Sequential Training: Train subsequent models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the previous model by focusing more on the misclassified instances.\n",
    "Weight Adjustment: Assign weights to each training sample. Initially, all samples are equally weighted. After each iteration, increase the weights of misclassified samples so that the next model focuses more on these harder cases.\n",
    "Model Combination: Combine the predictions of all the models by taking a weighted sum (for regression) or a weighted vote (for classification)."
